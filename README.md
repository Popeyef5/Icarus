# Icarus

### About
This is the home for the different iterations and versions of the Icarus rockets. Like the name suggests, their purpose is not to fly too high, although they probably will anyways. Rather, they are meant to be reusable testcases for the more realistic and complex Hermes rockets.

### Content
For now, this repository will host periodically updated STEP files of all the designs. Although the design is going to happen using Fusion 360, until a suitable way to develop the rocket in a collaboratory way that is efficient and safe for the project is presented, only these periodic updates will be hosted here.

### The bigger picture

The Icarus rockets are part of the Hermes Project, an initiative whose goal is to create open-source reliable model rockets. There is so much to do besides CAD design: coding, Data analytics, Graphic design. If you want to know more and/or feel like you could help in any way, come say hi!
